        <h4>Description and mannerisms</h4>
                <h5>Formidable Presence</h5>
                <p>
                    The barkeeper stands behind the polished mahogany counter, exuding a rugged strength that fills the room, commanding attention with his burly physique and intense gaze.
                </p>

                <h5>
                    Weathered Wisdom
                </h5>
                <p>
                    A salt-and-pepper beard frames his face, adding a touch of wisdom to his rugged appearance, hinting at the stories etched in the lines of his weathered skin.
                </p>
                
                <h5>Inked Tales</h5>
                <p>
                    Intricate tattoos adorn his muscular arms, serving as visual narratives that showcase battles fought and victories won, adding to his aura of invincibility.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Guardian of the Bar
                </h5>
                <p>
                    With a booming voice and hands calloused from years of labor, the barkeeper stands as both a fierce protector and a warm confidant, ensuring order and tranquility in the bustling tavern.
                </p>
        <h4>Traits, abilities and items</h4>
        <h5>Hefty cudgel</h5>
        <p>2D6: Gnarled and ugly, but perfectly weighted. A souvenir from the new world, collected from a dunk soldier unable to settle his tab.</p>
        <h4>Secrets</h4>
        <h5>Concealed Meetings</h5>
        <p>
            Through discreet observation, the bartender has witnessed Hilda and Igor's secret rendezvous, their stolen moments of affection hidden away from prying eyes, fueling the intensity of their love.
        </p>
        <h5>A Jealous Footpad</h5>
        <p>
            The bartender has overheard murmurs of jealousy from a footpad within Hilda's clan, who harbors deep feelings for Igor. Consumed by envy, this footpad longs to eliminate Igor, seeing him as an obstacle to their own desires.
